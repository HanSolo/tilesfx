## Intro
The Tile is a simple JavaFX Control that comes with different skins.
To get an idea on how to use the skins with their parameters you could
either take a look at the [Demo file](https://github.com/HanSolo/tilesfx/blob/master/src/main/java/eu/hansolo/tilesfx/Demo.java)
or check out the [TilesFX Demo](https://github.com/HanSolo/tilesfxdemo) project
which also contains information on how to combine TilesFX with other libraries
e.g. [Medusa](https://github.com/HanSolo/Medusa)
You can also check my [blog](https://harmoniccode.blogspot.com/search/label/tilesfx)
where you will find additional information about certain tiles. 

## Demo
To run the demo you simply can start it using the command "./gradlew Demo" on the command line in the project folder.
